# Raw TS/JS Tower Defense "Demon TD"
HTML5 canvas and non - framework js approach using webpack as a bundler, and a babel as a parser and converter of ts into common js.
I have chosen to create a game where could use some well forgotten math and additionaly try out some advanced and rarely used at work html elements such as audio/canvas.
